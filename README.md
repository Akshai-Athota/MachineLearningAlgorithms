# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a comprehensive **Machine Learning portfolio**, where major algorithms are implemented from scratch, reinforced with mathematical intuition, and compared with standard `scikit-learn` implementations. The goal is to build a deep understanding of each method and have a practical showcase for ML skills.
